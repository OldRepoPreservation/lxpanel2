Programming:
1. Split the main program lxpanel and the applet library liblxpanel-applet.
   This can prevent back-linking into the executable binary, which is non-portable.

2. Add some file management functionality utilizing libfm

3. Add a GtkTreeView based new application menu.

Documentation:
1. Write API doc with valadoc and generate gtkdoc compatible files.
   Using valadoc with automake is currently undocumented, but an example is here:
   http://code.google.com/p/bump/source/browse/bump/Makefile.am

2. Write a wiki article about config file format.

3. Write a wiki article/tutorial about how to develop an applet.
